<h2>Description</h2>
MediaGen is a comprehensive movie and TV show database enabling users to search for any desired film or series. It provides extensive details including release date, genres, plot, and production info for each title. Powered by Python's Streamlit framework, the web app provides an intuitive interface, while leveraging the TMDB API to seamlessly fetch and display extensive details about movies and shows.

I was inspired to create MediaGen due to my deep passion for movies and TV shows. Spending countless hours exploring platforms like IMDB and Letterboxd, I marveled at their extensive databases and user-generated content. These platforms provide comprehensive information on virtually every TV series and movie imaginable, offering invaluable reviews and a robust rating system.

With MediaGen, my aim was to develop a platform that could emulate the functionality of these beloved sites. For my inaugural large-scale personal project, I envisioned a platform where users could discover recommendations and more, akin to the experience provided by IMDB and Letterboxd.
